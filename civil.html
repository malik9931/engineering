        <h2>What is civil engineering?</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, what is civil engineering? Civil engineering is the professional practice of designing and developing infrastructure projects.
            This can be on a huge scale, such as the development of nationwide transport systems or water supply networks, 
            or on a smaller scale, such as the development of individual roads or buildings.

        <p>
            All aspects of building a structure fall under the remit of a civil engineer. This can include planning, design, budgeting, surveying, construction management and analysis,
             and often civil engineering careers encompass a combination of all these elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Civil engineering specializations</h2>
        <p>The civil engineering specializations you choose will depend on the kind of structures you’re most interested in,
             and which part of society you’d like to help build or improve. Some of the most common specializations include:</p>

        <p> 
            <h4>Structural engineering</h4>
            Unsurprisingly, structural engineering focuses on structures. This could include houses, bridges, theatres, schools, hospitals and dams, but also machinery and vehicles – even air and space craft.

            <h4>Architectural engineering</h4>
            In many ways architectural engineering is very similar to structural engineering, but generally this specialization is more focused on details and systems within structures – such as heating and lighting systems, ventilation and acoustics. Although heavily scientific, architectural engineers will also be greatly involved in the aesthetic design of their structures.

            <h4>Transportation engineering</h4>
            Transportation engineering is concerned with the design of infrastructure to support travel by air, at sea and on land. This covers the planning and improvement of roads and railway systems, ports and harbors, airports and runways.

        <h2>Civil engineering careers</h2>

        <p>
            Civil engineering careers are both rewarding and challenging and can involve elements of construction,
            design, leadership and management, depending on your interests and specialist knowledge gained at university. You’ll often find ample opportunities for creativity and innovation, as well as the rewards of seeing projects come to fruition. All civil engineers need a good knowledge of design and construction methods, current technologies and best practices, as well as relevant legislation and regulations.

            Civil engineering careers often offer good prospects for progression, and the potential to earn a better-than-average salary,
            with many countries worldwide forecasting high demand in the coming years.

            While the engineering sector offers a wide variety of different roles,
            some of the most common civil engineering career paths include:
